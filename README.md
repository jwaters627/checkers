# checkers
this is a checkers game that can be run from the terminal.
To run the game you just need to run ruby checkers_board.rb
the game will prompt you to choose what position you will be moving and then what position to move to.  The format required to choose 
  the positions is first the vertical position from the top where the first row is 0 and then the horizontal position from the first 
  column where the first column is 0. So 0,0 is the top left position.  1,0 is one below the top left and so on
